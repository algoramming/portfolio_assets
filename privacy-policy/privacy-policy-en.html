            your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g.,
            Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell
            towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20
            meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS
            signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide
            directions, but it is not always perfectly precise. We obtain and

          logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
          information about you from your social media provider. The profile
          information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
          concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
          list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
          make public on such a social media platform.

          are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by
          your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review
          their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share
          your personal information, and how you can set your privacy
          preferences on their sites and apps.

          We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and

          and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission

          to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,

          to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
          modify your information.

          No mobile information will be shared with third parties or affiliates

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
          standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
          this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
          browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
          legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
          respond to them at this time.

        <p>
          Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
          authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a
          request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they
          have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with
          applicable laws.
        </p>
        <h3>Request Verification</h3>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
          request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we cannot verify your identity from the information already
          maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
          information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
          security or fraud-prevention purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
          collect additional information to verify your identity before
          processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written
          and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.

          for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a
